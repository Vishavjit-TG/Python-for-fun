# Python-for-fun
This is where I publish my python scripts that I create to automate some small stuff. 

1. Copyfiles_to_TargetFolder.py
This Python Script will copy files from different directory and  push it to target folder as specified.

Problem: I used everything to search for some files and then copied them and want to move to target folder for analysis. 

2. Get a free account on macaddress[.]io and grab the API and convert multiple MAC addresses to vendor.  This works better than free checks from macvendors[.]io in my investigations.
