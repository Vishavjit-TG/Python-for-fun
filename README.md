# Python-for-fun
This is where I publish my python scripts that I create to automate some small stuff. 

**1. Copyfiles_to_TargetFolder.py**

This Python Script will copy files from different directory and  push it to target folder as specified.
Problem: I used everything to search for some files and then copied them and want to move to target folder for analysis. 

**2. maccadressTOvendorv1.py**

Get a free account on macaddress[.]io and grab the API and convert multiple MAC addresses to vendor.  This works better than free checks from macvendors[.]io in my investigations. 

**3. maccadressTOvendorv2.py**

Convert MAC address to vendors without account creation thus free.

**4. mergingdocx.py**

add word file names in current directory and it will combine them to one word file

**5. wordfilesize_split.py**

Splits big word files (docx) to 10 files

**6. docxTOtxt.py** 

docx to text file converter
